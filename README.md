A simple online shop web design project using HTML and CSS involves creating a visually appealing and functional website that allows customers to browse and purchase products or services. This typically involves creating different pages for product categories, individual product pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout page. HTML is used to structure the content and layout of each page, while CSS is used to style the design elements, such as fonts, colors, and images.
